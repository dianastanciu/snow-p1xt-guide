// BASE

// A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors.
//
// Base styles include setting heading sizes, default link styles, default font styles, and body backgrounds. There should be no need to use !important in a Base style.
